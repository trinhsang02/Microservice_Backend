# Blockchain Listener Service

The Blockchain Listener service is responsible for listening to blockchain events and processing them accordingly. This service is a crucial component of the microservices architecture, enabling real-time interaction with blockchain data.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd golang-microservices/blockchain-listener
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   Update the configuration settings in `main.go` as needed to connect to your blockchain network.

4. **Run the Service**
   You can start the Blockchain Listener service by executing:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

Once the service is running, it will start listening for blockchain events. You can monitor the logs for any incoming events and their processing status.

## API Endpoints
